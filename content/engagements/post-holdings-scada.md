## Project Summary

Post Holdings, a major food manufacturer with multiple production facilities, needed a unified SCADA architecture to improve visibility, streamline operations, and scale with confidence.

This engagement involved a multi-site digital transformation initiative with high complexity, aging equipment, and fragmented systems.

---

## The Challenge

- Legacy HMIs across plants with no centralized view
- Critical operations running on unsupported hardware and outdated software
- No real-time data visibility across facilities or corporate
- Limited standardization between engineering teams and sites
- Growing need for traceability, reporting, and operational KPIs

---

## The Approach

- Conducted detailed plant assessments across facilities
- Designed a scalable Ignition-based SCADA architecture
- Implemented a Unified Namespace (UNS) model with MQTT edge gateways
- Standardized Rockwell PLC communications and tag naming
- Enabled real-time dashboards, alarms, and historian data streams
- Coordinated training and documentation for maintenance and operations

---

## Outcomes

- 75% reduction in downtime due to centralized monitoring and alarming
- Over 1,200 data points standardized across sites
- Engineering efficiency improved through reusable templates and scripting
- Created a roadmap for MES layer integration and future expansion
- Positioned Post Holdings for vendor-agnostic scaling and data-driven decisions

## Why Vlad?

With deep experience in both legacy systems and modern architectures, I was able to bridge the gap between engineering, IT, and operations.

I understand both the plant floor and the business case. That made it possible to design solutions that worked for operators, engineers, and executives alike.
